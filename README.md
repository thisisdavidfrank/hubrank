# How to launch/deploy the application
The build folder has the fully built application. All that is required is to copy the contents of the build folder into a folder named 'hubrank' inside any HTTP Server's root server directory. For example, create a folder called 'hubrank' inside Apache Server's "htdocs" folder and then copy the build folder's contents into it. Then simply launch the application using the HTTP server's url followed by "/hubrank". For example, http://localhost/hubrank.
